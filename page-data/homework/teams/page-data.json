This will then enable you to access the development clusters for IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift. The Resource group will have pre installed content and you will be restricted from creating new cloud services or deleting existing ones.\n\n- Each **Development Team** will consist of **30+** Garage colleagues.\n\n\nThe following diagram helps to explain how access will be configured.

You will be expected to create all your git projects in your teams organization. This is how real world development projects work. This will enable you to collaborate with your fellow team members and will prevent you from creating duplicate projects names.\n\n![MOOC Teams](moocteams.png)\n\nThere will an IBM Kubernetes Cluster in the same `Resource Group` and you will get bonus _credits_ if you can deliver some of the home work onto that cluster as well. IBM Garage is getting a number of client requests that may require upstream kubernetes to be used for specific use cases. It is important you become familiar with both premier container platforms. The developer experience is the same for both container platforms.\n\n<p></p>\n\n## Team Locations\n\nThe teams are spread globally in three geographic locations listed below.
