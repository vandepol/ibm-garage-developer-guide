These have been designed to give you a production ready\nentry point for cloud native development. There are a small number of templates\nthat provide support for different architecture layers of your Kubernetes solution these includes:\n\n- User Interfaces\n- Backend for Backends\n- Microservices\n- Machine Learning (coming soon)\n\nYou can pick the starter kit template that best meets your requirements and it will seamlessly integrate\nwith the installed development tools.\n\nYou can work with [Code Patterns](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/) from  [developer.ibm.com](https://developer.ibm.com/).\nYou will need to upgrade the `Dockerfile` to be UBI compliant and add a `Jenkinsfile` or `Tekton pipeline`. These patterns are\nnot optimised for production usage and do not include a number of key IBM Garage best practices. They are fully open source and they\ncan be enhanced overtime.\n\nThere is more information below on what is included in the **Starter Kit Templates**.\n\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![Starter Kit Architect](architecture.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n\n## Why another code template\n\nAs teams have built out production solutions using IBM Kubernetes Services and RedHat OpenShift\non the IBM Cloud it has became clear that starting with a `hello-world` type template slows down a project.\n\nIn cases where you are learning the basic principles of cloud native development with a specific language it does help to start with the basic principles of `hello-world` but when you are building production code to be used by real users it takes a lot of effort to industrialize this code ready for production.\n\nThe objective of the *Starter Kit Templates* is to kick off a project quickly so they can reach maximum development velocity in the least amount of time. To not contain any business logic and to have a set of proven opinionated frameworks that are commonly used in the industry this can include `Express`, `React` and testing frameworks.\n\nWhy starter kit templates ? As the approach to cloud native microservice development has evolved\na number of language frameworks have come into play, runtime configuration technologies and best practices\nto improve quality and robustness.

They all have most of the\nfeatures listed below. They must be UBI ([Universal Base Image](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image)) based\nso they can run in side Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Kubernetes Service. They must have a `Dockerfile` that uses that UBI.\nTo make them work with Continuous Integration you can provide a Pipeline defined in **Jenkins Pipeline** or **Tekton Pipeline** format.\n\nMake sure there is a good use case that is repeatable in your solution architecture. Make sure the code is documented and includes a `README.md'.
